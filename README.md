A simple game to play with an Arduino (or compatible) and some LEDs

## How to play
Once the game begins the 11 LEDs in the row will start flashing sequentially one after the other slowly and rising the speed more and more based on the level the player is playing.
To go to a next level the player needs to push a button in the very middle of the LEDs row
